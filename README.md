## My Contributions to this Project
When working on this project aided in all aspects of creating it in both hardware and software but was the main person to handle the software.

### Software
While working on the project I had programmed the entire website utilizing css, html, flask, jinja2, and bootstrap. 
The backend that was running on the raspberry pi for the project was utilizing excel template files that are being modified and read through the website.
All changes that are made to the website through auto timed scanning, changing schedules, and engaging in manual feedings are handled through bash scripting.
The bash scripting I have made for this project runs certain shell files that handle a variety of tasks such as modifying the backend data, sending signals to the motor on the product, scanning the bluetooth tag, and more.  

### Hardware
When handling the hardware I have assisted in the construction of the product and configuration of the raspberry pi.
I enabled port forwarding on the local router and SSH on the raspberry pi in order to ensure product use outside the LAN and remote control of the raspberry pi respectively.
Due to time contraints it was not feasible to create a professional looking chasis for the product. 

### Thank You
Thank you for taking the time to view my project. I hope you have a wonderful day!
